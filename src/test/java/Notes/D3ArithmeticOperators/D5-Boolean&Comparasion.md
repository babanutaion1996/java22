# Boolean Data Type
- The boolean data type is a primitive type that can store two possible values: Those are 'true' or 'false'.
This data type typically used for decision-making in programs, sucha sa checking conditions and controling the flow of code.
### Usage of Boolean Type
* Boolean variable are often used to represent the outcome of logical conditions.
* To create a boolean variable :
```java
boolean isEmpty = false;
boolean canPass = true;
```

# Comparasion Operators
- Comparison operators are used to compare two value. These comparisons yield a boolean result ('true' or 'false'). The result of comparasion can be stored
in a boolean variable or used directly in conditional statements (if,loops).

|   Operator        |     Symbol    |         Description                               |   Example  |     Result     |
|   Equal To        |       ==      |         Check if two values are equal             |   4 == 4   |     true       |
|   Not Equal       |       !=      |         Check if two values are not equal         |   4 != 4   |     false      |
| Greater than      |       >       |         Check if the left value is greater        |   11 > 7   |     true       |
|   Less than       |       <       |         Check if the left value is smaller        |   7 < 11   |     true       |
|  Greater or equal |     >=        |         Check if the left is greater or equal     |   14 >= 14 |     true       |
|  Less or equal    |     <=        |         Check if the left is smaller or equal     |   21 <= 30 |     true       |
